RECURRENCE RELATION: $T(n) = 2T\left( \frac{n}{2} \right)+o(n)$

TIME COMPLEXITY: $O(n\log n)$

Recursive algorithm to sort a data set.

DIVIDE AND CONQUER type of algorithm.

DIVIDE: 

Takes an array, RECURSIVELY divides it into multiple sub-arrays until reaching the base case.

Base Case: 1 element per array.
